However, the ease of use and understanding comes at the price that Python is less energy, time and memory efficient as slightly more complex languages such as C or C++.\n",

For example, the header names might not line up with your data columns, and the data may have too many decimal places.

For example, we can force the number of decimal places in the three columns of data by setting the following keyword in the <span style=\"color:blue\">savetxt()</span> function: <span style=\"color:blue\">fmt=\"%.d %.2e %.2e\"</span>.\n",

This means that the top-level elements of the list are copied, but the inner list [1, 2, 3] is still referenced by both i and j. Therefore, when changes are made to the inner list, it affects both i and j.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, i[3].append(4) appends 4 to the inner list in i, which also reflects in j since they refer to the same inner list. Similarly, j[3].append(5) appends 5 to the inner list in j, which also affects i.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we check i[3] is j[3], it will return True because both i[3] and j[3] are referencing the same inner list. This shows that despite i and j being different objects at the top level, they share the same reference to the inner list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a **shallow copy**. In a shallow copy, a new object is created with the same values at the original except that any objects that are contained within are merely pointed to.\n",

    "### Tuples\n",
    "Tuples behave very similarly to lists, but are immutable (i.e. they cannot be changed). Tuple literals are created by writing a sequence of items separated by commas, optionally surrounded by parentheses. To get a tuple with only one element, you need to have a comma after the element.<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = 1,2,3\n",
    "my_tuple = (1,2,3)        # equivalent\n",
    "not_a_tuple = 1           \n",
    "a_tuple = 1,\n",
    "a_tuple = (\"first!\",)     # here the first and only element of the tuple is \"first!\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many aspects of Python are implicit tuples. For instance, the assignment operator '=' will happily assign tuples of names to tuples of values:<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A,B,C = 1,2,3\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is the same as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(A,B,C) = (1,2,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is the same as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = 1\n",
    "B = 2\n",
    "C = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour can be easily used to swap the names of data:<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A,B = 1,2\n",
    "A,B = B,A\n",
    "print(A,B)   # prints 2,1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "The third most common collection data type used in Python is the Dictionary, or dict, which store mappings from keys to values. For every key, there is a value, which can be almost any Python object. Keys are usually strings, but it is possible to use certain other objects as keys. Dictionary literals are written as a comma-separated list of key:value pairs, with a colon separating key from value, surrounded by curly brackets. Dict items are accessed using the key within square brackets.<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student_grades = {\"Simon\": 60, \"Jenny\":68, \"Laura\":112}\n",
    "student_grades[\"Laura\"] = 100 # Change Laura's grade.\n",
    "student_grades[\"Pug\"] = 58    # New student!\n",
    "print(student_grades[\"Jenny\"])\n",
    "68\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### When should you use each data type?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important question to ask yourself when first thinking about a problem is what data structure is the best for you to use? There is no universal answer and will really depend on the situation. When to use a dictionary is pretty straightforward, they are used when you want to link one set of values to another. A phonebook which links a person's name to their number is a good use of a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use a list or tuple can be harder to understand. The key difference between lists and tuples is that tuples are immutable, i.e once created they cannot be altered. Therefore a sequence in the form of a tuple can be used if you don't expect the sequence to change or even don't want them to change. However if you want to add or remove elements from a sequence during your code execution then lists are the data structure to go with.\n",
