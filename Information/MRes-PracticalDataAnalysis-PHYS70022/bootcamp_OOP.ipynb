    "\n",
    "### Procedural Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The code we have looked at so far took a **procedural approach** to programming. In procedural programming, there is a clear distinction between variables (and the data structures that hold them) and the procedures (functions, subroutines, blocks of code) that operate on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Orientated Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, variables and data structures are **bundled together** with procedures into **objects**.  The OOP approach allows a complex programming task to be broken down into self-contained components that can be used by other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "All individual objects have three basic characteristics:\n",
    "- **Identity** (i.e. name, this must be unique and distinct)\n",
    "- **State** (describes the current properties of the specific object)\n",
    "- **Behaviour** (refers to actions the object can take)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language fully supports the object-oriented programming **paradigm**. Although it is possible to ignore the object-oriented aspects of Python and treat it as a procedural programming language, practically everything in Python is in fact an object. Data structures and variables are objects. Data types are objects. Imported modules are objects. In Python, even functions are actually objects.\n"

    "A method can be thought of as a reference to the function in the class. When one calls the method, the class function is called with the instance inserted into the parameter list as the first parameter. For example, `c.addone()` is equivalent to `Counter.addone(c)`. This allows `addone()` to have access to the attributes of this particular instance of the class. Similarly, `c.reset(5)` is equivalent to `Counter.reset(c, 5)`.\n",

    "Notice that the first argument in the definitions of the methods of the class is called `self`. In fact this is only a convention: there is nothing special about the name self and you could use whatever you like. However, it is a VERY strong convention and if you want your code to be readable to other Python programmers you are strongly encouraged to stick to it. (Similarly, it is a good idea not to use the name self for anything other than the first argument in a class method function.)"
