# Week 2 - Statistics

## Introduction

* Physicists hate statistics. 
* Physicists are scared of statistics
* Mathematicians make statistics even scarier and incomprehensible
* A lot of texts on statistics are for medics so are written in crayon and are too simple making them incomprehensible. They are usually for different types of problem and these texts say very little so are also incomprehensible. Medics are even more scared of statistics that physicists so they get told almost nothing.
* Almost all statistics you need are relatively easy - Gaussian. You've already done them.  You just need a reminder and a lot more confidence. We really don't need to get very complicated most of the time (just as well for me).
* The best places to learn about statistics are by Physicists e.g. astrophysics. They talk at the right level for us. 
    - Press et al, "Numerical recipes". Text free to download. Ignore the code.  The text and the outlines of the basic algorithms are what you will find most useful.

## Gaussian Distribution 

**TODO** Find the course and notes that students are given on statistics. Get a copy of notes.

* Basic properties
* Central Limit theorem
    - Example of central limit theorem at work. Experimental reults for real value.  Choose from various defitions e.g. uniform, and show that arrive at Gaussian shape.
	- Further examples e.g. more distributions for students to do later
    - Optional exercise an example of a failure?
* z scores here?
    - Example. Students working on different experiments with different means and std.dev. who got the best result?
* &chi;-square here?

## Poisson and Binomial Distribution
