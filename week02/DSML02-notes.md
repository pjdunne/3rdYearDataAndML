# Week 2 - Statistics

Listed on options fair handout as "Probability and random variables - Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial". The topics in this week should be a review of previous course work though apparently it was in term 3 of the first year and was not examinable. 

## Input from MRes Statistics course Phys70021

The MRes Statistics course Phys70021 and in particular the notes from part 1 `StatisticsPart1.pdf` are particularly useful here.


* Section 2 Probability p5. Basic properties of probability, how much do we need of the formal definition? Perhaps mention Frequentist vs Bayesian and quote Bayes but no detail. Falg as something for more advanced (MRes) discussion
* Section 3 Probability distributions p9. 
	* The Poisson distribution  (Continuous random variables?)
	* Gaussian distribution, χ2 distribution 
	* Generating random variables - needed? For synthetic data sets, hypothesis testing?
	* Leave out the following? 
		* Binomial distribution, 
		* Moments of probability distributions, 
		* Compositions of probability distributions
* Section 4 Large numbers, central limit theorem 

## Introduction

* Physicists hate statistics. 
* Physicists are scared of statistics
* Mathematicians make statistics even scarier and incomprehensible
* A lot of texts on statistics are for medics so are written in crayon and are too simple making them incomprehensible. They are usually for different types of problem and these texts say very little so are also incomprehensible. Medics are even more scared of statistics that physicists so they get told almost nothing.
* Almost all statistics you need are relatively easy - Gaussian. You've already done them.  You just need a reminder and a lot more confidence. We really don't need to get very complicated most of the time (just as well for me).
* The best places to learn about statistics are by Physicists e.g. astrophysics. They talk at the right level for us.

    - Notes from MRes Statistics course Phys70021 and in particular the notes from part 1 `StatisticsPart1.pdf`. Parts of these notes are mathematical than the tone we will set for the UG.  We may not need this level of mathematical description or maybe it is the least we need.

## Gaussian Distribution 

We have Statistics of Measurement course PHYS40005 notes that students are given on statistics. We could work with that notation and provide these notes.

* Basic properties
* Central Limit theorem
    - Example of central limit theorem at work. Experimental reults for real value.  Choose from various defitions e.g. uniform, and show that arrive at Gaussian shape.
	- Further examples e.g. more distributions for students to do later
    - Optional exercise an example of a failure?
* z scores here?
    - Example. Students working on different experiments with different means and std.dev. who got the best result?
* &chi;-square here?

## Poisson 

Discrete distribution, binned data.

## Binomial Distribution 

At the moment leave Binomial to onside, perhaps a non-examinable comment to remind students of link. This is not a statistics course
