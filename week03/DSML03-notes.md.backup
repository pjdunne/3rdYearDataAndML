# Week 3 - How to formulate your problem 

Listed on options fair handout as "How to formulate your problem - Statistics, likelihoods/target functions".


* Not really sure what this should include yet. In particular, statistics should have been covered in previous years and then reviewed in week 2.
* This week we aim to define the process and language of hypothesis testing. 
* Week 4 can be implementing the langauge and tools of weeks 2 and 3 for the example of fitting

The MREs Statistics course Phys70021 and in particular the notes from part 1 `StatisticsPart1.pdf` are particularly useful here.


* Section 5 Estimators: Bootstrapping (here or elsewhere?), Estimating Mean and Standard deviation (Guassian example, Method of moments), Linear regression with least squares. See `Bootstrapping.ipynb`. Perhaps leave out section 5.3 Properties of good estimators, bias, etc?

* Section 6 Hypothesis testing including type-I and type-II errors  (vs. false positive, false negative). Leave out section 5.2 Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests? 
* Section 7 Likelihoods
	* Neyman-Pearson Lemma
	* Likelihood-based goodness of fit test 
	* Maximum likelihood estimators
	* Gradient based optimisation (outline, no details, no 7.4.1, 7.4.2?)
	* Least squares from MLEs
	* How much of section 7.6 "Properties of maximum likelihood estimators" do we need? Figure 14 seems a key example but maybe could go elsewhere. 
	* Real-life examples might be useful for use somewhere e.g. for students to work through
* Section 8 Uncertainty Intervals 
	* Neyman construction and confidence intervals, Likelihood ratio test-statistic 
	* Unsure how much of secion 8 we should include, say 8.1.1 onwards
