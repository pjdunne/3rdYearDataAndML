# Week 1 - The Prologue

Some notes on possible content for week 1.  


* Better titles?

## Course structure 

Explain culture and approach of course.  

* This is a practical course, more like lab, learning through practical numerical exercises. Not a theory course based on lectures and exercises.
    - The problem with this view is that I think that even in third year lab there are GTA assistants around most of the time?

* Each seven days we have the following 
	- Wednesday 09.00-09.50. One lecture in computer suite presented by staff member, Tim Evans (CoUniverse/Centre for Complexity) or Patrick Dunne (CoParticles/iX)
	- Wednesday 10.00-11.50  Two hours of shared/group learning in computer suite. 
	- Wednesday Office Hour 11.00-11.50?
	- Wednesday to Monday following week. Finish exercises in Jupyter Notebook.
	- Monday/Tuesday following week. Presentation with staff member and graduate student(s)

* Additional help
    - Recommended books including online and legally free resoucres
	- Blackboard (BB)
	- Discussion Board on BB

## Programming

A reminder of key elements. Simple exercises.

* Reading data in and out
* Plotting basics
* Use of Jupyter notebooks and python. 
* Anything else needed from later part of the course? 


## Simple example

Something to illustrate what we will be able to do even though before we undertand what we are doing?

* Something with nice visual impact but where we can flag deeper issues that may lie behind nice graphics
    - Clustering of staff in the depratment based on representative text? 
* Use one example in lecture picking up the programming points and finishing with an ML flourish e.g. clustering of data
* Second example in for students to do in own time
