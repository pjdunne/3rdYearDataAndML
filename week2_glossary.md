# Glossary

**Sample space**: The set of possible values for a random variable, e.g. the numbers 1-6 on a six-sided die, or the range of numbers a uniform probability distribution is defined over.
**Frequentist probability**: Defining the probability of value of a random variable as how frequently that value is selected in repeated trials. A particular value that is observed M times in N trials is said to have a probability of M/N.
**Bayesian probability**: Defining probability as a degree of belief in an outcome; depending on what you think is likely to happen based on the information you have, the Bayesian probability can change. 
**Conditional probability**: The probability of one event given that another event has already occurred, e.g. the probability of taking this course given that you are a 3rd year undergraduate vs given you are a 2nd year.
**Independent events**: Events where one occurring has no effect on the probability of the other occurring. The probability of event B has no dependence on what happens for event A.
**Bayes theorem**: The theorem for updating our estimate of probability for an event, under a Bayesian probability framework. 
**Marginal probability**: The probability of an event occurring (or of measuring a set of data).
**Prior**: The probability of your initial value or your degree of belief in your hypothesis.
**Likelihood**: The probability of an event occurring (or measuring your data), given your initial parameter value or hypothesis.
**Posterior**: The probability of your initial value or hypothesis, given a particular event has occurred (or given you have measured a particular dataset)
**Probability density function**: A function that tells you the relative probability of a value of a continuous-valued random variable. To find the probability of a range of values of a random variable, you must integrate the probability density function over the range. Must integrate to 1 over the whole sample space.
**Cumulative density function**: A function of a random variable that when evaluated at a value $x$, describes the probability of measuring that random variable to have a value equal to or less than $x$. 
**Probability mass function**: A function for a discrete random variable that gives the probability of each possible discrete value of that random variable. Similar to a probability density function, but for discrete random variables.
**Joint probability density function**: 
**Marginal density**
**Expectation**
**Algebraic moments**
**Central moments**
**Covariance**
**Central limit theorem**
**Monte Carlo technique**
**Inverse function**
