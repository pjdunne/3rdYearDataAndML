In this example we will focus on a linear regresison task, and you will have the opportunity to try a nonlinear task in Exercise Two. We can generate toy data for regression using the ```make_regression``` function from sklearn:"

    "Note: sklearn has a couple different implementations of SVR for different cases. For a linear regression task, it is best to use ```LinearSVR```, rather than ```SVR``` with ```kernel = 'linear'```. This is due to the specific implementation of these functions: ```LinearSVR``` **only** implements a linear kernel, but for linear regression tasks is much more efficient than using ```SVR```. Beyond the additional ```kernel``` parameter for ```SVR```, the syntax is otherwise the same. We will see more about kernels in Section 3. "

Also note that because we have a lot of data points in the Califorina housing dataset, training SVMs in general can take a long time. The time taken to train SVMs for large amounts of data is one of the reasons they aren't used as commonly as e.g. neural networks (which you will see in Week 9): they are not as scalable.**\n",
