    "Andriy Burkov. \n",
    "- This is a great conceptual book on ML, with a reasonable summary of the mathematics. A free sample of the book is available (up to about page 34). Copies are available in the college library.\n",

    "2) [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by Aurélien Géron. \n",
    "- A great hands-on book for ML to take you from no knowledge to implementing models, and has sufficient detail to take you into the understanding of the algorithms. This book also has a good collection of the original papers cited and links to them on their website. There is also much information on the [github](https://homl.info). An online version can be accessed through the college library, if you search it by name through the library website. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/). This is a more introductory level than one above, however it is really well written and takes you through things more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of other good and more theoretical ML books but the above are practical while having enough theory for you to understand them. In this course we only have time to teach you the basics and to touch on a few techniques. These books will take you further.\n",

    "So far, applying ML has seemed pretty simple. However, there are many possible pitfalls with these approaches that you need to be aware of. In fact, there have been several high-profile incidences of machine learning algorithms going wrong. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amazon's development of an AI tool to help shortlist job applicants, which was trained on the previous 10 years of resumes submitted to Amazon. Because these resumes were predominantly from male candidates, the algorithm \"learned\" that male candidates were more likely to be successful and therefore penalised resumes that had terms identifying it as a female applicant. Attempts were made to reduce the bias but ultimately were unsuccessful and the [project was scrapped](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45809919).\n",
    "* Microsoft's AI chatbot Tay, which was released on Twitter and learned from interacting with people on the platform. [Within 16 hours the project was taken down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(chatbot)) as the AI started posting racist and sexist tweets, due to learning from users spamming it with politically incorrect phrases and disciminatory language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the model just learns from your data, if you are not careful with what is in your training data you can easily produce results that are a) unexpected, and b) undesirable. This is one of the many reasons why it is important to visualise and understand your training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few possible challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Insufficient training data**: to build an accurate, generalisable model, you typically need **a lot** of training data; insufficient data means your model can't accurately learn the function $f$ and so cannot make accurate predictions\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Biased training data**: perhaps more dangerous than insufficient training data, as biased training data can mean your model does very well in some cases, but very poorly in others. This can be e.g. an imbalanced training dataset, where you show more examples of one class than the others like the Amazon example above, or systematic issues with measurement e.g. poor thermal contact, zero error, background noise etc.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Poor quality training data**: if your data is noisy, or has a lot of outliers, your model cannot accurately learn the function mapping inputs to targets. For data with values missing for some features (e.g. if you have issues with measurement equipment) you can mitigate to some extent by either taking a median value or setting it to far outside of a reasonable range so the model learns not to use it.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overfitting**: overfitting describes the situation where a model learns how to predict the training data and **only** the training data. The model is sufficiently complex that it can perfectly fit the training data, e.g. fitting a high order polynomial to data that is perhaps better modelled as a linear relationship with some noise. This results in poor prediction for unseen data, but can be mitigated at training time by including **regularisation**.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Underfitting**: the opposite of overfitting, this occurs when your model is not sufficiently complex to capture the features of the data. As a result, it is not capable of learning the function behind the data. An example would be trying to fit a quadratic dataset with a linear model.\n",

The linear model clearly underfits and does not accurately approximate the data, whereas the high-order polynomial (order 300) overfits, resulting in predictions that will not generalise despite good performance on the existing data.*"
