These include (in reverse alphabetical order): N.Wardle, F.Schaap, N.Reed, K.Joseph, C.Jing, A.Hussain, T.S.Evans, P.J.Dunne, D.J.Colling. The notebooks are derived from those used in the Masters  (MRes) course, [Machine Learning and Big Data in the Physical Sciences ](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/machine-learning-physical-sciences/), run here in the Physics department and we would like to thank those who created these MRes notebooks. Various other lecturers also provided us with access to their teaching material and we thank them for that.\n",

You can run a code cell, edit it, then run it again in which case the original version of that cell is no longer visible. You do not need to run the code cells in the order in which you read them, from top to bottom. These features are the biggest weaknesses of notebooks. For instance, you can't always tell from a quick look exactly what state your system is in e.g. which variables are defined and to what values.
